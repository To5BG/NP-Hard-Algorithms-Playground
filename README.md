# CSE3300
Coursework for CSE3300 Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems  
This repository contains the group's solutions for three assigments, covering three topics in designing algorithms for NP-Hard problems:
1. Heuristic Search - Sokoban AI solver
2. Cosntraint Programming - General constraint solver
3. Mathematical Programming, Simulation, and Sampling - Several math problems
