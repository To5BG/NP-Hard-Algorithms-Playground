## Coursework for mastering algorithmic techniques on NP-Hard problems
This repository contains solutions for three problems, covering three major topics in designing algorithms for NP-Hard problems:
1. Heuristic Search - Sokoban AI solver
    * A* search, with *playerbox* state hashing
    * *Manhattan/Pythagorean* distance metric
    * *Closest/Greedy* matching assignment
    * *Simple/Freeze/Corral* deadlock detection
2. Constraint Programming - General constraint solver (used for Combinatorics, NQueens, Sudoku)
   * *ALL/SATISFY/COUNT/MIN/MAX* problem types
   * Generalized with parameter and variable *binds*
   * *alldiff/decreasing/[custom]* propagation
   * *Symmetry breaker*
   * Search pruning
   * Variable selection
3. Mathematical Programming, Simulation, and Sampling - Several math problems 
   * Simulating common distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial, Cantor, Pareto, Exponential, Normal, 
Chi-Square, Gamma, Dirichlet, etc.
   * Monte-Carlo approximation for multi-dimensional integration
