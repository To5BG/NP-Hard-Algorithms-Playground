# CSE3300
Coursework for CSE3300 Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems  
This repository contains the group's solutions for three assigments, covering three topics in designing algorithms for NP-Hard problems:
1. Heuristic Search - Sokoban AI solver
    * A* search, with *playerbox* state hashing
    * *Manhattan/Pythagorean* distance metric
    * *Closest/Greedy* matching assignment
    * *Simple/Freeze/Corral* deadlock detection
2. Constraint Programming - General constraint solver
3. Mathematical Programming, Simulation, and Sampling - Several math problems
